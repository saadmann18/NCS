# NCS
# noise cancelling system.
# Vanilla Auto Encoder
# Unsupervised learning
# Representation Learning, learning patterns in dataset
# a bottelneck between input and output layer

# from vanilla AE to variational AE, because, 
# data is not symmetrical data around origin, more variance, so we need to:
# modify encoder,
# modify loss func.

# VAE
# normal-distribuiton, univariate normal distribution, std normal.
# mean, variance both are handeled, mean is at origin, std dev is 1.
# gaussian pdf
